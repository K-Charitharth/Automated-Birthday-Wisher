# Automated Birthday and Anniversary Wisher

Welcome to the project repository for my **Automated Birthday and Anniversary Wisher** project, developed in August 2023. This project showcases my Python programming skills, problem-solving abilities, and proficiency in object-oriented design.

## Overview

The **Automated Birthday and Anniversary Wisher** is designed to streamline the process of sending personalized wishes via email for birthdays and anniversaries. By utilizing the Schedule library in Python, this project automates the task of sending greetings on special occasions.

## Features

- **Automated Scheduler:** The heart of the project, a scheduler runs at specified intervals to check for upcoming events (birthdays and anniversaries) and triggers the sending of wishes.

- **Modular System:** I engineered the system using distinct classes for data management, greetings composition, and email sending. This showcases my skills in object-oriented design and keeps the codebase organized.

- **Dynamic Ordinal Suffixes:** To ensure accurate message generation, I implemented dynamic ordinal suffixes for years, adding a personalized touch to the greetings.

- **Yagmail Integration:** I employed the Yagmail library for seamless email communication, making the process of sending wishes efficient and hassle-free.
